	</header>
	I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering 
	<a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie" target="_blank">ORIE</a>, Cornell University. 
	I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/katya-scheinberg" target="_blank">Katya Scheinberg</a> at Cornell ORIE and 
	Dr. <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-lamnguyen.mltd" target="_blank">Lam Nguyen</a> at IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center. 
	<br>
	
	My research interests are Optimization, Machine Learning and other Applications. 
	You can find a recent version of my CV <a href="files/CV_TrangTran.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

	I grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam. I got my Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Education at Hanoi National University of Education. 
	Then I spent one year for graduate study at the Institute of Mathematics in Vietnam and later moved to Cornell University for my PhD. I obtained an MS degree from Cornell in August 2023. 
	In summer 2022 and 2023, I was fortunate to do AI research internships at IBM Research (Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY), mainly advised by
	my mentor <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-lamnguyen.mltd" target="_blank">Lam Nguyen</a>.
