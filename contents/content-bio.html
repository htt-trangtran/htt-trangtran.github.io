	<p>
    I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Lehigh University. 
    I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Luis Nunes Vicente and participate in the 
    <a href="https://optml.lehigh.edu/" target="_blank">Optimization and Machine Learning (OptML)</a> group.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests are Optimization for Machine Learning.

    I grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam, and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Education from Hanoi National University of Education in 2019. 
    I then spent one year in graduate studies at the Institute of Mathematics in Vietnam before pursuing my PhD at Cornell University’s 
    <a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie" target="_blank">School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE)</a>. 
    I obtained an MS degree from Cornell in August 2023 and completed my PhD in 2025 under the guidance of 
    Prof. <a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/katya-scheinberg" target="_blank">Katya Scheinberg</a> 
    (now at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech) and 
    Dr. <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-lamnguyen.mltd" target="_blank">Lam M. Nguyen</a> at IBM Research.
</p>
<p>
    During my PhD, I completed research internships at IBM Research (Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY) 
    in summer 2022 and 2023, mainly advised by my mentor 
    <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-lamnguyen.mltd" target="_blank">Lam M. Nguyen</a>. 
    In summer 2024, I received the Siegel Family Endowment PiTech PhD Impact Fellowship to work at 
    <a href="https://adaptcommunitynetwork.org/" target="_blank">ADAPT Community Network</a> (New York City, NY).
