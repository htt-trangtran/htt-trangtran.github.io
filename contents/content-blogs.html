		My first paper was accepted to <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/" target="_blank">ICML 2021!</a>

	I'm fortunate to be advised by my mentor Lam Nguyen, who guided me doing research since the very first steps. 
	Without his endless passion and valuable advice, I wouldn't be able to publish this paper in my first year.  
	Although I and Lam never had a chance to meet in person due to the pandemic, this project has become a wonderful journey for me. <br>
	
	This is also the first time I made a poster, and an illustrative image:	
	<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="files/SMG_image.png" alt="" /></a>
	Although the image for traditional update cannot exactly (mathematically) depict the proportion of gradients, I still think this is a good explanation for the exponential weight.
