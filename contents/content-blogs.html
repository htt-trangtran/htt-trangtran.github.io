	My second Spring semester at Cornell ends with this beautiful view - and with a paper accepted for publication at ICML 2022.

	This semester was very challenging, and whenever I felt down, this view would cheer me up. 
	It reminds me that I am fortunate to receive great education, 
	and sometime little joys come from the books that I can always borrow in the school library. 
	In addition, I have my mentor and my advisor with me along the way, 
	and I am forever grateful for what they have done to help me accomplish wonderful things in research.
	<br>
	
	(As always, we have a colorful <a href="files/NASG_poster.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a> for our paper. 
	This publication is in the same research direction with our SMG paper in ICML 2021.)

		<strong>My first paper about SMG algorithm was accepted to <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/" target="_blank">ICML 2021</a>!</strong>

	I'm fortunate to be advised by my mentor <a href="https://lamnguyen-mltd.github.io/" target="_blank">Lam Nguyen</a>, 
	who has supported me doing research from the very first beginning steps. 
	Without his endless passion and valuable advice, I wouldn't be able to publish this paper in my first year.  
	This project has become a wonderful journey for me. 
	Though I and Lam never had a chance to meet in person (due to the pandemic), we still enjoy every moments in this journey together.
	<br>
	
	I'm also happy that this is the first time I made an illustrative image for my work:	
	<br>

	</center>
	Actually the image for traditional update did not exactly depict the proportion of gradients (mathematically speaking).
	However, I still think this is a good explanation for the exponential weight. 
	Indeed this is the motivation and observation behind the proof of Theorem 3 in our paper. 
	The full text of our paper is available <a href="https://htt-trangtran.github.io/files/SMG.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<!--It also explains why we need the single shuffling schemes. Therefore extending this result for random shuffling scheme remains a challenge for us. -->
	
	<br>
	Although our paper still has some weaknesses, we believe that SMG algorithm and our theoretical contribution will be helpful for the community. 
	I really hope to continue collaborating with Lam and other experts, therefore contribute more to this research area.
